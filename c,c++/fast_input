while using scanf, if you know that the next input is in next line then always write scanf("%d\n",&test);

As such even scanf is slow, use getchar()

example:
#define isdigit(c) (c >= '0' && c <='9')
while(!isdigit(ch))ch = getchar();
do {num = num*10 + ch-'0';ch=getchar();}while(isdigit(ch));
arr[i][j] = num;
}
}
